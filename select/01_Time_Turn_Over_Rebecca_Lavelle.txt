Give me this day
All I ask of you is time
Just one more day
Just one more day
I can't see the reason
For you to walk away
When we've come so far
Come so far
Chorus:

I'm lost in the dark
Without a road to travel on
Time turn over
Start again, start again
Time turn over
Find my way to you again
Words are unspoken
Burled so deep
Time they saw the light of day
Time they saw the light
I'm missing your touch
I miss you so much
And all I want to say is
And all I want to say
Chorus x2

Time turn over
Start again, start again
Time turn over
Find my way to you again
