Turn Over The Pages and see what's on the other side
Will you do it quickly there's something that I'm trying to hide
See the picture that's reaching us, a mother and her son
She's got no food, no house and no money
But she'll tell you she's the lucky one

Turn over the TV, see what's on the other side
Well if that's the horror movie we've been taken for a ride
But it's real, they're not acting, that's not what I paid to see
Hand me down my pen and paper, 'cause I'm writing to the I T V

There they go each Sunday, they're just trying to spoil our fun
Right in the middle of our dinner, here comes another one

You better keep your hands in your pockets, your eyes upon the floor
You better disconnect the buzzer and double lock the door
There's one down on the pavement so maybe you should cross the road
But that's someone's life she's ravelling (?), we all hate to be told
